* Mcor Iris Protocol Documentation
** Intro
This document describes the communication protocol between the Mcor
SliceIT software and the Mcor IRIS printer. With this, developers
should be able to create their own software to talk to and control the
Mcor printer, as well as dissect and analyze print sessions.
** Communication
All communication between the software and the printer happens via
telnet, over the default telnet port 23.
** Protocol
The communications protocol works in a request/receive fashion, using
specially formatted ASCII strings.

The host will send a string that ends with the \r\n (0x0d 0x0a). After
this, the printer will send back data, ending with a ":" (0x3c)
character. Whether this data contains any information other than the
":" character depends on the query.

*** Parameter Requests
Most communication between the host and the printer is the host
requests status from the printer. This happens in the form of a string
that ends with a "=", e.g. "mach_id=" (plus the usual "\r\n" ending)
requests the machine version of the printer. The printer will then
respond with data, e.g. " 47.0000\r\n:", which means the printer has a
machine ID of 47.
*** Parameter Assignments
The host can also assign parameters on the printer, using a similar
format. For instance, to set the number of expected pages in the
upcoming print, the host will send something like "numpage=156". The
response from the printer will simply be a ":" character.
