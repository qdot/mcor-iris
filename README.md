# Mcor IRIS Protocol Reverse Engineering

This repo contains logs, documents, and scripts for reverse
engineering the communications protocol for the Mcor IRIS 3D Printer.

http://mcortechnologies.com/3d-printers/iris/

The goal is to have a complete document of the protocol between the
Mcor SliceIT software and the printer. Most of the interesting
information found from this project can be found at:

[docs/mcor-iris-protocol.org](docs/mcor-iris-protocol.org)
